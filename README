Passive Electronic Component Calculator

This tool is inteded to simplify the selection of capacitors, inductors, and resistors.

It uses pre-supplied lists of available components to generate usable passive networks that approximate a desired value.

=== Available Passives ===
Currently supplied resistors are the E96 and E24 series.
Currently supplied capacitors are a subset of the 0603 RF capacitors on DigiKey
Currently supplied inductors are a subset of the 0603 inductors on DigiKey

If you have a list of component you commonly use, you can throw that at the tool also.
Note that lists are currently expected to be csv files in ascending order of component value.

Capacitance values are specified in pF.
Inductance values are specified in nH.
Resistance values are specified in Ohms.
